A simple component displaying the app logo and name: "ðŸŒ´Far Away ðŸ’¼".

### `Form`
A form that allows users to add items to the packing list. It takes a description and quantity as input, and submits the item to be added to the list.

### `PackingList`

### `Item`
Each item in the packing list is rendered as a separate `Item` component with options to mark it as packed/unpacked or delete it.
